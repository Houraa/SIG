# SIG - online SIG modelling

 This is an open-source Non Functional Requirement modelling tool. Its key distinguishing characteristics are:
  - it runs entirely on the browser, thus no installation needed
  - high visual fidelity (we want your diagrams to be pretty, even when printed)
  - supports the [SIG tool V.0.0.1 standard]
  
  This tool was first developed by Pimentel, João and Castro, Jaelson. piStar Tool – A Pluggable Online Tool for Goal Modeling. 2018 IEEE 26th International Requirements Engineering Conference, pp. 498-499.
  
  I changed the PiStar tool to SIG (SoftGoald Interdependency Graph)
